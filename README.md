# Snake Game

A classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food while avoiding running into walls or its own tail.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.
- The snake begins at a random position on the screen and starts moving in a random direction.
- The goal of the game is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible, represented by :red_circle: that appear randomly on the screen, without running into the walls of the game or the snake's own tail.
- Every time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making it harder to avoid running into its own tail.
- The game ends when the snake runs into a wall or its own tail. The player's score is determined by the number of pieces of food the snake ate before the game ended.
